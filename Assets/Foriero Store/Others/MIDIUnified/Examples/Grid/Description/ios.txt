2) In Installations directory install -> install_native_plugins.unitypackage

3) If you will use playmaker install first Playmaker and then install_playmaker_actions.unitypackage

4) switch your project to iOS

5) set Build Settings -> PlayerSettings
	Api Compatibility Level -> .NET 2.0
	ScriptCallOptimamizatin -> Fast but no exceptions
	iOS Version -> at least 5.1

6) Drag MIDIUnfied Init into your scene. 

7) Set iOS synth on MIDIUnified Init script if you want to have sound on your device. You can select number of channels and sample rate also. 

8) You can hide Midi Selection GUI -> there is show field on MIDIUnifiec Init -> MidiSelection script -> show

9) On MIDIUnified Init-> MidiUnified Init Script -> you also can set Default Midi In and Out. Then the script should always try to connect to these port numbers. On iOS it should be (if there is no USB Midi device connected) alway "Session 1" depends what you will set on OSX.

10) If you will write your own script dont forget to include : using ForieroEngine.MIDIUnified;
		
	And then for sednig for example controlling messages use just MidiOut.ShortMessage(int Command, int Data1, int Data2)
	For sending NoteON or NoteOFF there are help functions like MidiOut.NoteON(), MidiOut.NoteOFF()

11) Build. At the end of the building process you should get message that MIDIUnified has been installed properly. That means it was included automatically into your iOS project.
