Please notice Menu->Foriero->..... 

There you can see Settings->Midi ( which is where you set all your midi settings for different platforms )


Dear Users,

We took the pain out of using midi in Unity on both platforms WIN/OSX.
You have one set of API for both platforms. 
Our library is steadily growing into handy midi tool, that will hopefully help you to make incredible apps for both WIN/OSX platforms.

We have to give tribute to Leslie Sanford for his great work on C# MIDI TOOL KIT.

We wish you as much joy as we have with using midi in Unity Engine.

Kind regards,
Marek Ledvina. 


We did our best to simplify using midi in unity as much as possible. So there is not much requiered to be done from your side. 

Try to use prefabs that you will find in Foriero/MIDIUnifie/MIDIUnfied/Prefabs

Especially the one called "MIDIUnified Init.prefab". It is the basic settings for all platforms. You can learn from this prefab how we initialize all inputs and outputs.

There are also other prefabs that are pretty simple. Check them there. 

Go to Menu->Foriero->Settings->Midi Settings
