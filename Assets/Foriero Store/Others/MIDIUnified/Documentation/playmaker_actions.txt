Dear Users,

As a logical continuation of our MIDI Unified package, we have prepared for you and also for us a MIDI ACTIONS for PLAYMAKER.

These actions are in most cases self explanatory and more over we use tooltips wherever it is possible so please check these. 

If you have any wish or suggestion how to improve our product please contact us at : assetstore@foriero.com

REQUIERMENTS : Unity Pro, PlayMaker 1.1 or later, MIDI Unified package 1.4 or later

With kind regards,
Marek Ledvina
