	IMPORTANT Bug fixed MidiSelection.cs

VERSION 1.54

	OSX

	Refined MidiSelection.cs

	OSX
		Added virtual destination so other application can connect to your unity app.
		
	Known Issue OSX
		The plugin is not capable to send from a plugion midi messages to hardware devices. There is a work around with MIDIKeys application. Connect MIDIKeys to "Unity Midi Source" and output it to your hardware device. 
		http://www.manyetas.com/creed/midikeys.html
